# Add and Search Word

Design a data structure that supports adding new words and finding if a string matches any previously added string.

Implement the `WordDictionary` class:
- `WordDictionary()` Initializes the object.
- `void addWord(word)` Adds `word` to the data structure.
- `bool search(word)` Returns `true` if there is any string in the data structure that matches `word`. `word` may contain dots `'.'` where dots can match any letter.

**Example:**
```
Input:
["WordDictionary","addWord","addWord","addWord","search","search","search","search"]
[[],["bad"],["dad"],["mad"],["pad"],["bad"],[".ad"],["b.."]]
Output:
[null,null,null,null,false,true,true,true]
```

**Constraints:**
- 1 ≤ word.length ≤ 25
- word in addWord consists of lowercase English letters
- word in search consists of '.' or lowercase English letters
- At most 2 dots are allowed in a search word
- At most 10⁴ calls will be made to addWord and search
